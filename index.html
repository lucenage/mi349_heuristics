<h1 id="introduction" class="header">Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design | Instagram Edition </h1>
  
<p>These are <em>Jakob Nielsen's</em> 10 general principles for interaction design.</p>
<p><strong>Better known as "heuristics", because of how these vast rules serve as guiding points and not literal guidelines for usability.</strong></p>

<br>

<h2 id="visibility">#1 Visibility of System Status</h2>
<p>Within the both the Instagram website and mobile app, users can have access to a feature call 'Instagram Stories'. In this feature, users can see temporary content from other users that they follow. This content usually lasts about 24 hours on a user's account. Instagram utilizes this feature to provide new updates to the application for their users. Typically titled, 'New!', users can see these new updates to application that the company feels were a good addition to meet the needs and expectations of their users. This shows the visibility of system status as users are able to easily view the new updates and features of the application as time goes on.</p>

<h2 id="match">#2 Match Between System & the Real World</h2>
<p>When users go to their account settings and select 'Language', the application prompts the users to go their device's settings to adjust the language in which they wish to view the application in. When doing so, users can see that Instagram is structured to match the same langauge as to what they are accustomed to using in their lives. On top of this, users can see that Instagram is utilizing the user's dictionary and vocabulary to prompt users with similar/suggested words that they utilize. This shows how Instagram tries its best to match up with the real-world diction of the user.</p>

<p><img id="second" src=second.png alt="Screenshot demonstrating Nielsen's second principle that can be seen with Instagram."></p>


<h2 id="freedom">#3 User Control & Freedom</h2>
<p>Throughout the application, Instagram has various clearly marked exits for users to leave any unwanted state that they have on the application. The application supports the means of un-doing actions via a 'cancel' button or an 'x' symbol on their screen when they accidently click on a particular action that would result in the user from sending or posting something to the application. This offers users freedom and control with their decisions. This can be seen with how users have the accessibility of canceling their actions with no real hassle from the application.</p>

<p><img id="third" src=third.jpg alt="Screenshot demonstrating Nielsen's third principle that can be seen with Instagram."></p>

<h2 id="consistency">#4 Consistency & Standards</h2>
<p>Instagram utilizes consistency and standards to have users know what to expect and how to operate its interface. This means that whether a user decides to access the application via the website on a computer, mobile device, or even through the mobile app, Instagram tries its best to provide users with a similar experience; if not the exact same. The interface that users become accustomed to will then become the standard that they will expect any time that they decide to use the application. This sets Instagram to the expection of meeting this standard. As seen with the image below, Instagram's appearance to users is consistent when accessed through the mobile website as well as the mobile app.</p>

<p><img id="fourth" src=fourth.jpg alt="Screenshot demonstrating Nielsen's fourth principle that can be seen with Instagram."></p>

<h2 id="error">#5 Error Prevention</h2>
<p>Within the application, users have the option to delete their posts from the platform. There can be many times where users might actually delete a post. Instagram decided to better check for these situations and present users with a confirmation option before users completely go through with their decision of deleting a post. By doing this, users have a bit of safety from deleting posts accidently. Moreover, Instagram has the "Delete" text in red to show up more to the eye and have users pay more attention that they are risking the deletion of their post(s). This is error prevention as it shows the application helping  users from accidentally deleting their content and allowing them to think again before going through with their decision.</p>

<p><img id="fifth" src=fifth.png alt="Screenshot demonstrating Nielsen's fifth principle that can be seen with Instagram."></p>

<h2 id="recognition">#6 Recognition Rather than Recall</h2>
<p>Instagram utilizes recognition rather than recall. This can be seen because its interface is designed to facilitate memory recognition, allowing for more cues to be available to facilitate information retrieval. This is occurs by the application storing user data. Within the application itself, this can be seen with the search function of Instagram. Instagram will show users previous search under the search bar (as seen with the image below), so that they may revisit old searches instead of attempting to remember what they searched.</p>

<p><img id="sixth" src=sixth.png alt="Screenshot demonstrating Nielsen's sixth principle that can be seen with Instagram."></p>

<h2 id="flexibility">#7 Flexibility & Efficiency of Use</h2>
<p>If you are a frequent user of Instagram, the platform allows for users to save their login information for sign-in verification to one's account. This creates a more efficient use of time on the application as users will be able to bypass the sign in process for their account due to their account information being saved into the device for later use. Additionally, when users follow certain accounts on the platform, Instagram offers to the option to provide users with a list of other accounts to follow based upon the users activity and interests. This shows the application is molding and being flexible to the actions of the user to provide optimal content that might interest the user and have them use the application more efficiently.</p>

<p><img id="seventh" src=seventh.png alt="Screenshot demonstrating Nielsen's seventh principle that can be seen with Instagram."></p>

<h2 id="aesthetic">#8 Aesthetic & Minimalist Design</h2>
<p>This can be seen with the overall layout of the application. Instagram provides users with the content of the accounts they follow first along with the Instagram Stories section and access to direct messages. Beyond that, users will have the option to move off of the primary page and go to their own profile or explore page. However, the primary focus in on the primary page showing users their feed. Therefore, this shows that Instagram designed their application to have users focus more on the home page and view the content of those that they follow and minimize the other features of the application for background tasks that the user can endulge in if they so choose.</p>

<p><img id="eighth" src=eighth.png alt="Screenshot demonstrating Nielsen's eigth principle that can be seen with Instagram."></p>

<h2 id="diagnose">#9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover from Errors</h2>
<p>When users on Instagram find an error, they often times get prompted by Instagram itself regarding the issue and offer a solution. In the instance below, we can see that the user is facing an account login error. As a result, Instagram prompts an error message in plain language. The message from Instagram is stating that the user could not login into Instagram's server. As a result, Instagram suggests that the user verifies that they have a stable internet connection and to wait a moment or two before attemping to login again. This shows how Instagram helps users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors that may occur.</p>

<p><img id="ninth" src=ninth.png alt="Screenshot demonstrating Nielsen's ninth principle that can be seen with Instagram."></p>

<h2 id="documentation">#10 Help & Documentation</h2>
<p>Instagram aids users by providing both a 'Report a Problem' section as well as the 'Instagram Help Center' for any issues that users may be experiencing. With these in place, the application does its best to troubleshoot any problems that the user may be facing. Additionally, the application provides users with information regarding various issues that a user may face and how they can resolve their problems. This information can help with users attempting to perform certain tasks/actions and offer steps for solutions. Instagram provides help and documentation by providing users with a page full of information to aid users with any issues that they may face.</p>
